## Motivation
This is my first ever game developed in Unity. With no background in game development or pixel art, this project was a journey into new territories, aiming to learn and create from scratch. With a background in the Java programming language, I have a fair grasp of C# language, although it was challenging to adapt to it since I am accustomed to Java coding conventions.

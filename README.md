# Space Cake

### Motivation
This is my first ever game developed in Unity. With no prior background in game development or pixel art, this project was a journey into new territories, aiming to learn and create from scratch. With a background in Java programming, I had a fair grasp of the C# language, though it was challenging to adapt since I'm accustomed to Java coding conventions.

## About This Game
Humanity’s last and most glorious cake—an irreplaceable confection of legendary sweetness—has been stolen by extraterrestrial creatures! As the bravest (and hungriest) space marine in the galaxy, it’s up to you to embark on an epic sugar-fueled quest across the stars. Your mission: to blast, dodge, and outwit these cosmic cake thieves and reclaim the final slice of humanity’s dessert destiny… at all costs!

### Details
**Space Cake** is a tribute to the 1979 NES classic *Galaxian*, offering a modern twist on the retro, fixed-camera style. Like *Galaxian*, the game challenges players to defeat waves of enemies in space, but with exciting new additions such as unique power-ups and a final boss encounter. True to its arcade roots, there are no checkpoints, if you lose, you are taken back to the title screen to start again, maintaining the high-stakes excitement of classic arcade gameplay.
